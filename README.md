# Project Description
-	The perfect diet will be an application revolving around dietary needs and nutritional information of food items. The application will be targeting any user with one or multiple dietary needs to be considered in their daily life.
-	The problem that we aim to solve is for users who have multiple dietary needs and restrictions. The users with such complications can’t find one place to display all the food items that are allowed in their diet. Normally those users would have to search for each dietary restriction on its own and the collect data from multiple sources to choose his diet plan.
-	The application will include multiple filters that allow the users to choose from. Those filters will be applied to a huge database to show the user a list of foods compatible with their diets. Finding food items compatible with multiple dietary needs is very difficult and important. Also, the application will provide recipes that only include ingredients that are compatible with the diet provided.
